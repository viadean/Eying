# Code snippets to Emission Spectrum

### :cactus:MATLAB snippet

Creating and visualizing an **emission spectrum** with MATLAB involves plotting the intensity of emitted light at different wavelengths. This can be used to analyze fluorescence data or model emission characteristics of fluorophores.

Here's how to create an emission spectrum in MATLAB:

### Steps to Create an Emission Spectrum:

1. **Generate or load data**: You need a dataset containing wavelength values and corresponding fluorescence intensities. You can simulate data or import it from a file.
2. **Plot the data**: Use MATLAB's plotting functions to visualize the spectrum.

### Example MATLAB Code:

```matlab
% Define the wavelength range (e.g., 400 to 700 nm)
wavelength = 400:1:700;

% Create a synthetic emission profile (Gaussian distribution as an example)
peakWavelength = 520; % Center of the emission
width = 30; % Width of the emission curve
intensity = exp(-((wavelength - peakWavelength).^2) / (2 * width^2));

% Plot the emission spectrum
figure;
plot(wavelength, intensity, 'b-', 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)');
ylabel('Fluorescence Intensity (a.u.)');
title('Emission Spectrum');
grid on;
```

### Explanation:

- **Wavelength vector**: Represents the range of wavelengths over which the emission is measured.
- **Gaussian distribution**: Used to simulate an emission peak, with `peakWavelength` as the central wavelength and `width` controlling the spread of the curve.
- **Plot customization**: The `plot` function is used to visualize the data, with axis labels and a title for clarity.

### Customizing the Spectrum:

- **Real data**: Replace the synthetic data generation step with imported data if you have experimental measurements.
- **Multiple peaks**: Add more emission curves to simulate complex spectra by summing multiple Gaussian distributions.

### Additional Features:

- **Shading under the curve**:

  ```matlab
  fill(wavelength, intensity, 'b', 'FaceAlpha', 0.3);
  ```

- **Smoothing data**:

  ```matlab
  smoothedIntensity = smooth(intensity, 5); % Smooth with a window size of 5
  plot(wavelength, smoothedIntensity, 'r-', 'LineWidth', 2);
  ```

This approach provides a basic way to model and plot an **emission spectrum** in MATLAB, which can be extended or customized based on your specific research or data needs.

### :cactus:Python snippet

To create and visualize an **emission spectrum** using Python, we can simulate or plot data representing the intensity of fluorescence as a function of wavelength. This is often done by using libraries such as `matplotlib` and `numpy` for generating and plotting data.

Here's a step-by-step guide to generating and visualizing an emission spectrum with Python:

### Step 1: Import the Necessary Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Step 2: Generate Emission Spectrum Data

Simulate a typical Gaussian-shaped emission spectrum:

- **Peak wavelength**: The wavelength at which the emission is highest.
- **Standard deviation (width)**: Controls the spread of the emission curve.

```python
# Parameters for the emission spectrum
peak_wavelength = 520  # Wavelength at peak emission (in nm)
std_dev = 20           # Standard deviation for the Gaussian curve (spread)

# Generate wavelengths (x-axis) and intensities (y-axis)
wavelengths = np.linspace(400, 700, 1000)  # Wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm
intensities = np.exp(-0.5 * ((wavelengths - peak_wavelength) / std_dev) ** 2)  # Gaussian function

# Normalize intensities to simulate realistic emission spectrum
intensities /= intensities.max()
```

### Step 3: Plot the Emission Spectrum

```python
# Plotting the emission spectrum
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(wavelengths, intensities, color='blue', label='Emission Spectrum')
plt.title('Simulated Emission Spectrum')
plt.xlabel('Wavelength (nm)')
plt.ylabel('Normalized Intensity')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:

- **Gaussian Shape**: A common representation of an emission spectrum as most fluorophores emit with a peak intensity and taper off symmetrically or asymmetrically.
- **Normalization**: The intensity values are normalized to a range of [0, 1] for visualization purposes.

### Customizations:

- You can adjust `peak_wavelength` and `std_dev` to mimic the emission characteristics of specific fluorophores.
- For an asymmetric emission spectrum, you could use more complex functions or experimental data to create a more accurate plot.

This code provides a visualization of how the emission intensity varies with wavelength, which is crucial for understanding the spectral properties of fluorophores in fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy.

### :cactus:Julia snippet

Creating an **emission spectrum** using the Julia programming language involves plotting the emission wavelengths and their corresponding intensities to represent how a fluorophore emits light after excitation.

Here's how you can plot an emission spectrum in Julia:

1. **Install necessary packages**: You need `Plots.jl` or other plotting libraries like `Makie.jl` for visualizing data.
2. **Simulate or use real emission data**: Generate or use data that represents the emission intensity across different wavelengths.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Install Plots.jl**:
   Ensure `Plots` is installed by running:

   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add("Plots")
   ```

2. **Write a script for the emission spectrum**:
   Here's an example script that simulates emission data and plots it:

   ```julia
   using Plots
   
   # Simulated emission data (example with a Gaussian distribution)
   wavelengths = 400:1:700  # Wavelength range from 400 nm to 700 nm
   peak_wavelength = 510    # Peak emission at 510 nm
   width = 30               # Width of the emission peak
   
   # Gaussian function to simulate emission intensity
   intensities = exp.(-((wavelengths .- peak_wavelength).^2) / (2 * width^2))
   
   # Plot the emission spectrum
   plot(wavelengths, intensities, title="Emission Spectrum",
        xlabel="Wavelength (nm)", ylabel="Intensity (a.u.)",
        linewidth=2, color=:blue)
   
   ```

### Explanation:

- **`wavelengths`**: This vector represents the range of wavelengths.
- **`peak_wavelength`** and **`width`**: Control the position and spread of the emission peak.
- **`exp.()`**: The Gaussian function creates a bell-shaped curve representing the emission profile.
- **`plot()`**: Visualizes the emission spectrum with labeled axes and customized appearance.

### Customization:

- **Real Data**: Replace the simulated data with real emission values from experiments or a dataset.
- **Styling**: Adjust plot parameters like `color`, `linewidth`, and `legend` for better visual appeal.

This approach provides a simple way to create and visualize an **emission spectrum** in Julia, useful for applications in fluorescence microscopy, spectroscopy, and related fields.
