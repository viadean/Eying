# Code snippets to Mixed-Effect Models

### :cactus:R snippet

Mixed-effect models are statistical tools that are highly effective for analyzing data where measurements are taken across hierarchical or grouped structures, which is common in experiments that involve repeated measures, nested designs, or multi-level data. When analyzing selective perturbation effects—where a particular treatment or condition affects only a subset of the data or participants—mixed-effect models become particularly valuable because they allow you to capture both fixed and random effects in the analysis.

### Key Concepts for Mixed-Effect Models

- **Fixed Effects**: These represent the population-level effects of your main variables of interest. For instance, if you want to study the effect of a treatment on a group, the treatment variable is a fixed effect.
- **Random Effects**: These capture variations at the individual or group level that you do not necessarily need to model explicitly. For instance, participant ID can be a random effect to account for variability across participants.
- **Random Slopes**: Allow the effect of a predictor to vary across levels of a grouping variable. This is useful when the response to a treatment is expected to vary among individuals.

### Using R for Mixed-Effect Models

In R, the `lme4` and `nlme` packages are commonly used to build mixed-effect models. The `lme4` package, which provides the `lmer()` function, is particularly versatile and widely used. Here's how to use it to analyze selective perturbation effects:

1. **Install and Load the Packages**:

   ```R
   install.packages("lme4")
   library(lme4)
   ```

2. **Model Specification**:
   A typical mixed-effect model for detecting selective perturbation might look like this:

   ```R
   model <- lmer(response_variable ~ fixed_effect1 + fixed_effect2 + (1 + fixed_effect1 | random_effect), data = dataset)
   ```

   - `response_variable` is your dependent variable.
   - `fixed_effect1`, `fixed_effect2` are independent variables.
   - `(1 + fixed_effect1 | random_effect)` specifies a random intercept and random slope for `fixed_effect1` across the levels of `random_effect` (e.g., participants).

3. **Detecting Selective Perturbation**:

   - Selective perturbation implies that the treatment or condition affects specific subgroups or levels. To detect this, you can include interaction terms or look at the random slopes to see if there is variability in the effect across individuals or conditions.

   - For example:

     ```R
     model <- lmer(response_variable ~ treatment * subgroup + (1 | participant), data = dataset)
     ```

     Here, `treatment * subgroup` allows you to test if the effect of `treatment` varies depending on the `subgroup`.

4. **Model Fitting and Summary**:
   Fit the model and check the summary for insights:

   ```R
   summary(model)
   ```

   The output provides coefficients for the fixed effects, variance components for the random effects, and statistical tests for model terms.

### Interpretation of Results

- **Fixed Effects**: Check if the coefficients for the treatment, subgroup, or their interaction are significant. Significant interaction effects suggest selective perturbation.
- **Random Effects**: If the variance of the random slopes is significant, it indicates that the effect of a predictor varies across participants or conditions, which can be tied to selective perturbation.
- **Model Comparison**: Use likelihood ratio tests with `anova()` or information criteria like AIC/BIC to compare models with and without interaction terms or additional random effects.

### Advanced Analysis

- **Post-hoc Tests**: For more detailed pairwise comparisons or to check which subgroups are significantly different, use the `emmeans` package.

  ```R
  install.packages("emmeans")
  library(emmeans)
  emmeans(model, pairwise ~ treatment | subgroup)
  ```

- **Visualization**: The `ggplot2` package can be used for plotting model predictions and residuals.

  ```R
  library(ggplot2)
  ggplot(data, aes(x = predictor, y = response, color = treatment)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line(aes(y = fitted(model)))
  ```

### Example Scenario

Imagine you're studying the effect of a drug on cognitive performance, where only some participants (e.g., those with a specific genetic trait) show significant improvement or decline. A mixed-effect model would allow you to:

- Include the drug as a fixed effect.
- Include participant ID as a random effect to account for baseline differences.
- Add an interaction term to explore how the effect varies by genetic trait.

This approach provides a flexible and robust method for detecting and analyzing selective perturbation effects in complex data structures.

### :cactus:MATLAB snippet

Mixed-effect models are a powerful statistical tool used for analyzing data that has both fixed and random effects. MATLAB offers robust functions for implementing these models, which are particularly useful when dealing with complex experimental designs, such as those involving selective perturbations (e.g., treatments applied to subgroups within a population).

### Overview of Mixed-Effect Models

- **Fixed Effects**: These are consistent and repeatable effects across the dataset, such as the impact of a treatment that is consistently applied to all subjects in the same way.
- **Random Effects**: These vary at different levels of the model hierarchy, such as subject-specific responses or batch effects, and are used to account for data dependencies or nested structures.
- **Selective Perturbation**: In the context of biological or experimental data, selective perturbations could involve applying a treatment or condition only to certain subsets of the data and examining how this selective application influences the response.

### Implementing Mixed-Effect Models in MATLAB

MATLAB's `fitlme` function from the *Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox* is commonly used for fitting linear mixed-effect models. The function is flexible for modeling datasets with both fixed and random effects, making it suitable for detecting and analyzing selective perturbation effects.

#### Basic Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: Organize your data into a table where each row represents an observation, and columns represent variables (e.g., treatment, subject ID, response).
2. **Model Specification**: Define the model equation, specifying which variables are fixed and random.
3. **Model Fitting**: Use `fitlme` to fit the model to your data.
4. **Model Interpretation**: Analyze the results to interpret the effects of selective perturbations.

#### Example Code

Here's a simplified example to demonstrate how to set up and run a mixed-effect model in MATLAB:

```matlab
% Load or create a dataset
% Assume 'tbl' is a table with columns: 'Response', 'Treatment', 'SubjectID'
% 'Treatment' is a categorical variable indicating perturbation or control condition
% 'SubjectID' is a grouping variable for random effects

% Fit a mixed-effect model
lme = fitlme(tbl, 'Response ~ Treatment + (1|SubjectID)');

% Display the results
disp(lme);

% Extract and interpret model coefficients
coeffs = lme.Coefficients.Estimate;
```

### Detecting Selective Perturbation Effects

- **Model Terms**: By including interaction terms, you can test whether the effect of the treatment differs across subgroups (e.g., by adding `Treatment*Group`).
- **Random Slopes**: If you expect variability in how different subjects respond to the treatment, you can model this with random slopes (e.g., `(Treatment|SubjectID)`).

### Advanced Analysis

- **Model Comparison**: Use likelihood ratio tests (`compare(lme1, lme2)`) to determine whether including selective perturbation terms significantly improves the model.
- **Post-hoc Tests**: Perform pairwise comparisons to delve deeper into the significance of specific effects using `multcompare`.

### Visualization and Diagnostics

MATLAB provides tools for visualizing the results of mixed-effect models:

- **Residual Plots**: Assess model fit by plotting residuals.
- **Random Effect Plots**: Examine the estimated random effects using `plot(lme, 'random')`.
- **Interaction Plots**: Visualize how the effect of the perturbation varies across subgroups using `interactionplot`.

### Applications

Mixed-effect models in MATLAB can be applied to various fields:

- **Neuroscience**: Analyzing brain activity in response to different stimulations.
- **Pharmacology**: Assessing the impact of a drug on subpopulations.
- **Behavioral Science**: Studying how different groups react to specific interventions.

### Additional Tips

- **Scaling and Normalization**: Pre-process data as needed to improve model stability.
- **Model Selection**: Start with a simple model and progressively add terms to assess improvements.
- **Cross-Validation**: For robust conclusions, consider using k-fold cross-validation or bootstrapping.

By effectively employing MATLAB's `fitlme` and related functions, you can uncover nuanced insights into how selective perturbations impact outcomes, accommodating complex data structures and variability within your dataset.

### :cactus:Python snippet

Mixed-effect models are an essential tool in statistical analysis when you need to account for both fixed and random effects in your data, which is particularly useful in analyzing datasets where measurements are clustered or grouped. This approach is beneficial in detecting and analyzing selective perturbation effects, where an intervention or condition affects only specific parts of a dataset.

### Understanding Selective Perturbation Effects

Selective perturbation effects refer to scenarios where an intervention or treatment has a differential impact across different levels or subgroups in your data. For example, an experimental treatment may affect certain subjects or conditions more than others, and you need to model these variations to make accurate inferences.

### Mixed-Effect Models Overview

Mixed-effect models, or hierarchical linear models, consist of:

- **Fixed Effects**: Parameters associated with the entire population or certain experimental conditions.
- **Random Effects**: Parameters that vary at different levels of the dataset, such as between-subject variability.

The general form of a mixed-effects model can be represented as:
\[
Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ij} + u_{j} + \epsilon_{ij}
\]
Where:

- \(Y_{ij}\) is the response variable for observation \(i\) in group \(j\),
- \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) are the fixed-effect coefficients,
- \(u_j\) is the random effect for group \(j\) (assumed to be normally distributed),
- \(\epsilon_{ij}\) is the residual error.

### Implementation in Python

To implement mixed-effect models in Python, the primary package used is **`statsmodels`** or **`lme4`-like functionality in `statsmodels`**. Another powerful tool is **`mixedlm` from `statsmodels`**, which is well-suited for such analyses.

Here’s how to perform a mixed-effect model analysis in Python:

1. **Loading necessary libraries**:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import statsmodels.api as sm
   from statsmodels.formula.api import mixedlm
   ```

2. **Data Preparation**:
   Ensure your data is in a tidy format, where each row represents an observation with corresponding columns for the response variable, fixed-effect predictors, and group identifiers for random effects.

   ```python
   # Example data frame setup
   data = pd.DataFrame({
       'response': [2.4, 3.1, 2.9, 3.3, 4.0, 3.7],
       'treatment': [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],  # Fixed effect (e.g., treatment condition)
       'group': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C']  # Random effect (e.g., different subjects)
   })
   ```

3. **Model Specification**:
   Define your mixed-effect model using `mixedlm`.

   ```python
   model = mixedlm("response ~ treatment", data, groups=data["group"])
   result = model.fit()
   ```

4. **Model Interpretation**:
   Examine the model's summary to understand the fixed and random effects:

   ```python
   print(result.summary())
   ```

### Analyzing Selective Perturbation Effects

To detect selective perturbation effects:

- Look for significant interactions between fixed effects and group-level random effects.

- Use random slopes if you believe the effect of the treatment varies between groups:

  ```python
  model = mixedlm("response ~ treatment", data, groups=data["group"], re_formula="~treatment")
  result = model.fit()
  ```

### Practical Example

Imagine you are studying how a new drug impacts reaction times across different clinics. The clinics act as groups (random effects), while the drug condition is a fixed effect. The model helps detect if the drug’s impact on reaction time significantly varies across clinics.

**Code Snippet for Random Slopes**:

```python
model = mixedlm("response ~ treatment", data, groups=data["group"], re_formula="~treatment")
result = model.fit()
print(result.summary())
```

### Advanced Considerations

- **Model Selection**: Use likelihood-ratio tests or AIC/BIC for comparing models with different random structures.
- **Diagnostics**: Check for assumptions like normality of residuals and homoscedasticity.
- **Visualization**: Use tools like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to visualize effects and residuals.

This mixed-effect approach in Python provides a robust way to detect and interpret selective perturbation effects, accounting for both fixed and random variability in your data.

### :cactus:Julia snippet

Mixed-effect models are powerful statistical tools used to analyze data with multiple sources of variability, such as hierarchical or clustered data. These models are particularly useful for studies that involve detecting and analyzing effects that may vary within subgroups or when controlling for random effects.

### Using Julia for Mixed-Effect Models

Julia is a high-performance programming language that has gained popularity for data science and statistical analysis due to its speed and expressiveness. The **MixedModels.jl** package in Julia is a robust library for fitting and analyzing mixed-effect models. It is inspired by the `lme4` package in R but tailored for Julia's ecosystem.

### Application: Detecting Selective Perturbation Effects

Selective perturbation refers to an experimental setup where specific changes or interventions are applied to subgroups within a dataset. Analyzing these effects can benefit from mixed-effect models as they help capture both fixed effects (e.g., treatment effects) and random effects (e.g., subject-specific variability).

#### Steps for Analyzing Perturbation Effects with MixedModels.jl

1. **Install and Import the Required Package**:
   Ensure `MixedModels.jl` is installed in your Julia environment.

   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add("MixedModels")
   using MixedModels
   ```

2. **Prepare the Data**:
   Load and prepare your data in a format suitable for modeling. Julia's `DataFrames.jl` is often used for handling datasets.

   ```julia
   using CSV
   using DataFrames
   
   data = CSV.read("your_data.csv", DataFrame)
   ```

3. **Define the Model**:
   Mixed-effect models are defined using a formula interface. For example, if you are analyzing the effect of a treatment on an outcome with random effects due to participants:

   ```julia
   model = fit(MixedModel, @formula(outcome ~ treatment + (1 | participant)), data)
   ```

   - **Fixed Effects**: Terms such as `treatment` represent fixed effects that you want to estimate.
   - **Random Effects**: `(1 | participant)` specifies a random intercept for each participant, accounting for individual variability.

4. **Add Selective Perturbation Terms**:
   If your study involves a specific perturbation affecting only certain subgroups, you can include interaction terms or more complex random structures:

   ```julia
   model = fit(MixedModel, @formula(outcome ~ treatment * perturbation + (1 | participant)), data)
   ```

5. **Interpret Results**:
   The model's summary output includes:

   - Coefficients for fixed effects with standard errors and significance tests.
   - Variance components for random effects, showing the variability due to the random structure.

   ```julia
   println(model)
   ```

6. **Model Diagnostics**:
   Use diagnostic plots to assess model fit, such as residual plots or random effect diagnostics. This step helps ensure that the model assumptions are met.

### Example Use Case

Imagine you are studying the impact of a new teaching method on students' test scores. Your data includes repeated measures from students across different schools, and selective interventions are applied to certain schools.

- **Model Construction**:

  ```julia
  model = fit(MixedModel, @formula(test_score ~ method * intervention + (1 | school) + (1 | student)), data)
  ```

- **Interpreting Results**:
  Analyze the interaction term `method * intervention` to see if the teaching method's effect differs with the intervention.

### Advantages of Using Julia:

- **Performance**: Julia's speed allows for faster model fitting, especially beneficial when working with large datasets.
- **Flexibility**: `MixedModels.jl` supports a wide range of model structures and covariance types.
- **Interoperability**: You can leverage other Julia packages, such as `Plots.jl` or `Gadfly.jl`, for advanced visualization.

### Summary

Mixed-effect models in Julia provide a powerful framework for analyzing data with hierarchical or multi-level structures. When studying selective perturbation effects, these models can help quantify the differential impact of interventions while accounting for random variations.
