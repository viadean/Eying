# Code snippets to Pseudo-time Analysis

Pseudo-time analysis is an approach used primarily in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to study the progression of cellular states over time, without the need for direct time-course experiments. By organizing cells along a "pseudo-time" trajectory, researchers can infer the order of events and identify changes in gene expression that occur as cells transition through different stages. This method is particularly useful for understanding dynamic processes such as cell differentiation, disease progression, or response to external stimuli, such as drug treatment.

### :cactus:MATLAB snippet

Pseudo-time analysis is a powerful method for studying the progression of biological processes by ordering cells or observations along a hypothetical timeline that represents the progression of a process, such as cell differentiation or response to a perturbation. This analysis can be particularly useful for detecting and analyzing the effects of selective perturbations in time-course experiments or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. MATLAB, with its extensive toolbox and data visualization capabilities, is a suitable platform for performing such analyses. Here's a guide on how to perform pseudo-time analysis with MATLAB, focusing on detecting and analyzing selective perturbation effects:

### Steps to Perform Pseudo-Time Analysis in MATLAB

1. **Preprocess the Data**:

   - Import your gene expression data (e.g., scRNA-seq matrix).
   - Normalize the data (e.g., log-normalization or scaling).
   - Filter out low-quality cells or genes to ensure clean input data.

   ```matlab
   % Load data matrix
   data = readmatrix('gene_expression_data.csv'); % Replace with your file
   % Normalization step
   data_normalized = log1p(data);
   ```

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:

   - Use PCA or t-SNE/UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of the data and highlight relationships between cells.

   ```matlab
   [coeff, score, ~] = pca(data_normalized);
   % Visualize the first two principal components
   scatter(score(:,1), score(:,2));
   title('PCA of Gene Expression Data');
   xlabel('PC1');
   ylabel('PC2');
   ```

3. **Construct a Trajectory Using Pseudo-time Algorithms**:

   - Implement or use pre-built algorithms to infer the trajectory. MATLAB may not have direct packages for advanced trajectory inference like Monocle or Slingshot (available in R), but custom approaches using graph theory or available toolboxes can be implemented.

   ```matlab
   % For custom trajectory inference, build a k-nearest neighbor graph
   % Example with k = 5
   knnGraph = knnsearch(score(:, 1:2), score(:, 1:2), 'K', 5);
   
   % Further process this graph to define a pseudo-time path
   ```

4. **Order Cells Along the Pseudo-time**:

   - Use a root cell (start point) to order cells in pseudo-time. This step involves finding a starting cell (e.g., the one most similar to a known early stage) and performing shortest-path analysis along the constructed graph.

   ```matlab
   % Root cell index (manually chosen or identified by specific criteria)
   root_idx = 1;  % Example index
   distances = graphshortestpath(knnGraph, root_idx);
   
   % Order cells based on distances
   [~, pseudo_time_order] = sort(distances);
   ```

5. **Visualize Pseudo-time Progression**:

   - Plot cells colored by pseudo-time to visualize the progression.

   ```matlab
   scatter(score(pseudo_time_order,1), score(pseudo_time_order,2), [], distances, 'filled');
   colorbar;
   title('Pseudo-time Analysis');
   ```

6. **Detect and Analyze Selective Perturbation Effects**:

   - Overlay perturbation conditions on the pseudo-time analysis to see how they affect cell states along the trajectory.

   ```matlab
   % Assuming `condition` is a vector indicating perturbation states (0 for control, 1 for perturbed)
   scatter(score(:,1), score(:,2), 50, condition, 'filled');
   colorbar;
   title('Perturbation Overlay on Pseudo-time');
   ```

7. **Quantify Differential Expression Along Pseudo-time**:

   - Analyze specific genes for their differential expression along the pseudo-time and between perturbed and control conditions.

   ```matlab
   % Select a gene of interest and plot its expression along pseudo-time
   gene_idx = 10;  % Example gene index
   gene_expression = data_normalized(:, gene_idx);
   
   figure;
   plot(distances, gene_expression, '.');
   xlabel('Pseudo-time');
   ylabel('Gene Expression');
   title(['Expression of Gene ', num2str(gene_idx), ' Along Pseudo-time']);
   ```

### Tips for Enhancing the Analysis

- **Use External Libraries**: For more advanced trajectory inference (e.g., diffusion maps), consider integrating MATLAB with external libraries like Python's `scanpy`.
- **Bootstrap Analysis**: Conduct bootstrap analysis to confirm the robustness of the pseudo-time results.
- **Functional Enrichment**: Analyze differentially expressed genes for functional enrichment to understand biological implications.

### Conclusion

MATLAB's data processing and visualization tools, combined with customized scripts and algorithms, can facilitate pseudo-time analysis for detecting and analyzing perturbation effects in biological data. For more complex needs, integrating MATLAB with Python or R can offer additional capabilities, such as using Monocle or other specialized trajectory analysis tools.

### :cactus:Python snippet

Pseudo-time analysis is a computational method primarily used in single-cell RNA sequencing data to infer the trajectory of cellular processes, such as differentiation or response to perturbations, across time. This approach allows researchers to analyze how gene expression changes continuously over a "pseudo-time" axis, which represents a developmental or response process inferred from data rather than actual time.

To detect and analyze selective perturbation effects using pseudo-time analysis with Python, follow these main steps:

### 1. Preprocessing and Normalization

Prepare your single-cell RNA sequencing data:

- **Quality control**: Remove cells with low or high numbers of expressed genes and genes that are rarely expressed.
- **Normalization**: Apply normalization techniques such as CPM (Counts Per Million) or log normalization.

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

Reduce the data to lower dimensions for better visualization and analysis:

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** to reduce data complexity.
- **t-SNE or UMAP** to visualize cells in two or three dimensions.

### 3. Trajectory Inference

Apply a method to infer the trajectory:

- **Monocle**: A popular tool for pseudo-time analysis, which can be used in Python through the `scanpy` package.
- **Scanpy**: Provides an interface to process, cluster, and analyze pseudo-time with its integration of `paga` or `tl.dpt` (diffusion pseudotime).

### 4. Pseudo-time Assignment

Assign pseudo-time to each cell based on its position along the inferred trajectory:

- Use `scanpy.tl.dpt()` to compute diffusion pseudotime.
- Order cells along the trajectory and visualize.

### 5. Differential Expression Analysis

Detect genes or pathways that show differential expression across the pseudo-time trajectory:

- Use `scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups()` or differential expression tools like `DESeq2` (R) through Python-R integration.
- Identify perturbed genes by comparing expression patterns in treated versus control cells.

### Python Implementation Steps

Here's an outline of Python code using `scanpy` for pseudo-time analysis:

```python
import scanpy as sc

# Load data
adata = sc.read_h5ad('your_data_file.h5ad')

# Preprocessing
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_genes=200)
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=3)
sc.pp.normalize_total(adata, target_sum=1e4)
sc.pp.log1p(adata)
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, min_mean=0.0125, max_mean=3, min_disp=0.5)
adata = adata[:, adata.var['highly_variable']]

# Dimensionality reduction
sc.tl.pca(adata, svd_solver='arpack')
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=10, n_pcs=40)
sc.tl.umap(adata)

# Trajectory inference and pseudo-time
sc.tl.diffmap(adata)
sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10)

# Visualization
sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['dpt_pseudotime'])

# Differential expression analysis
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'dpt_pseudotime', method='wilcoxon')
sc.pl.rank_genes_groups(adata)

# Analyzing perturbation effects
# Mark cells with a 'perturbed' condition and repeat differential analysis.
```

### 6. Analyzing Selective Perturbation Effects

- **Comparison of Trajectories**: Use trajectory analysis to compare pseudo-time between control and perturbed conditions.
- **Gene Set Enrichment**: Identify pathways affected by perturbations using enrichment analysis tools such as `GSEApy` or `scanpy.tl.score_genes()`.

### Visualization Tips

- **Heatmaps** to show expression trends of key genes along pseudo-time.
- **Scatter plots** for visualizing changes in expression levels between conditions.
- **Gene expression trajectories** to overlay and compare between normal and perturbed groups.

### Tools and Libraries

- **Scanpy**: Comprehensive single-cell analysis in Python.
- **Anndata**: A data structure for single-cell data.
- **GSEApy**: For gene set enrichment analysis.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For advanced visualization.

### :cactus:R snippet

Pseudo-time analysis is a powerful technique used in bioinformatics and computational biology to order single-cell data along a trajectory that reflects an underlying biological process, such as cell differentiation or response to perturbations. When combined with selective perturbation data, it can help identify how different perturbations affect the trajectory of cell states.

Here's a guide on how to perform pseudo-time analysis in R to detect and analyze the effects of perturbations:

### 1. **Load Necessary Libraries**

To conduct pseudo-time analysis, you'll need specific R packages, such as **Seurat**, **Monocle 3**, or **Slingshot**. The following libraries are common choices:

```r
library(Seurat)
library(monocle3)
library(Slingshot)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

### 2. **Prepare the Data**

Ensure your single-cell RNA-seq data is pre-processed (e.g., normalization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction). For Seurat:

```r
# Load and preprocess data
seurat_obj <- Read10X(data.dir = "path/to/data")
seurat_obj <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = seurat_obj)
seurat_obj <- NormalizeData(seurat_obj)
seurat_obj <- FindVariableFeatures(seurat_obj)
seurat_obj <- ScaleData(seurat_obj)
seurat_obj <- RunPCA(seurat_obj)
seurat_obj <- RunUMAP(seurat_obj, dims = 1:10)
```

### 3. **Integration with Monocle 3**

For pseudo-time analysis, data can be transferred to Monocle 3:

```r
# Convert Seurat object to a Monocle 3 object
cds <- as.cell_data_set(seurat_obj)

# Preprocess data and reduce dimensions
cds <- preprocess_cds(cds, num_dim = 50)
cds <- reduce_dimension(cds)

# Order cells along the trajectory
cds <- order_cells(cds)

# Plot the trajectory colored by pseudotime or perturbation conditions
plot_cells(cds, color_cells_by = "pseudotime")
plot_cells(cds, color_cells_by = "perturbation")
```

### 4. **Identify Perturbation Effects**

To detect and analyze perturbation effects, overlay perturbation labels on the pseudo-time trajectory:

```r
# Ensure that perturbation conditions are part of cell metadata
colData(cds)$perturbation <- seurat_obj$perturbation

# Visualize how cells under different perturbations are distributed in pseudo-time
plot_cells(cds, color_cells_by = "perturbation")

# Analyze pseudo-time distribution between different groups
pseudo_time_data <- data.frame(
  Pseudotime = pseudotime(cds),
  Perturbation = colData(cds)$perturbation
)

# Compare pseudo-time distributions (e.g., using a boxplot)
ggplot(pseudo_time_data, aes(x = Perturbation, y = Pseudotime)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Pseudotime distribution by perturbation")
```

### 5. **Statistical Analysis**

Perform statistical tests to confirm significant differences in pseudo-time distributions:

```r
# Wilcoxon or t-test for pairwise comparisons
library(stats)
test_results <- pairwise.t.test(pseudo_time_data$Pseudotime, pseudo_time_data$Perturbation)
print(test_results)
```

### 6. **Additional Functional Analysis**

If you want to identify genes that are differentially expressed along the trajectory or in response to perturbations:

```r
# Differential gene expression analysis along pseudotime
diff_test_res <- graph_test(cds, neighbor_graph = "principal_graph", cores = 4)
head(diff_test_res)

# Visualize genes with significant pseudo-time dependencies
plot_genes_in_pseudotime(cds, genes = rownames(diff_test_res)[1:5], color_cells_by = "perturbation")
```

### **Summary**

- Use **Seurat** for data preprocessing and **Monocle 3** for pseudo-time trajectory analysis.
- Overlay perturbation conditions to visualize their impact on the trajectory.
- Perform statistical tests to identify significant differences between conditions.
- Conduct differential gene expression analysis along the pseudo-time to understand the gene-level effects of perturbations.

This approach provides a comprehensive framework to analyze and interpret how specific perturbations influence cellular trajectories in single-cell data.

### :cactus:Julia snippet

Pseudo-time analysis is a computational approach often used in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to order cells in a "trajectory" that reflects a dynamic process, such as cellular differentiation or response to treatment. This analysis helps in understanding how certain cell states transition over time, even if actual time data isn't available. It becomes particularly powerful for analyzing how perturbations, like drug treatments or genetic modifications, selectively affect cellular trajectories.

In Julia, implementing pseudo-time analysis involves leveraging packages and techniques for data handling, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and trajectory inference. Here’s a step-by-step outline on how to use Julia to conduct pseudo-time analysis and analyze selective perturbation effects:

### Step-by-Step Workflow in Julia

1. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing**:
   - Load your scRNA-seq or other single-cell data using packages like `CSV.jl`, `DataFrames.jl`, or `HDF5.jl`.
   - Normalize the data and perform quality control checks to remove low-quality cells.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Apply principal component analysis (PCA) or more advanced methods like Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for visualizing data in lower dimensions.
   - Julia packages for this step include `MultivariateStats.jl` for PCA and `UMAP.jl` for UMAP.

3. **Clustering and Cell State Identification**:
   - Cluster cells to identify cell states or subpopulations using algorithms like k-means or density-based clustering.
   - You can use `Clustering.jl` for various clustering algorithms.

4. **Trajectory Inference**:
   - Apply trajectory inference algorithms to order cells along a pseudo-time trajectory. Popular algorithms include Monocle (originally in R/Python) and Slingshot. Julia's compatibility with `RCall.jl` can help run R-based algorithms, but native Julia solutions involve constructing your own trajectory models or using flexible packages.
   - Use packages like `Graphs.jl` to build custom trajectory graphs or perform path analysis.

5. **Analyzing Perturbation Effects**:
   - To detect selective perturbation effects, compare trajectories between control and perturbed conditions. 
   - Evaluate how gene expression changes along the trajectory in different conditions using differential expression analysis with `DifferentialEquations.jl` or custom scripts.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize trajectories with `Plots.jl` or `Makie.jl` to create insightful 2D and 3D plots.
   - Overlay perturbation data to highlight differences in cell trajectories or states.

### Example Code Snippet

Here's a conceptual example showing some basic steps:

```julia
using DataFrames, CSV, UMAP, Plots, Clustering, Graphs

# Load data
data = CSV.read("scRNAseq_data.csv", DataFrame)

# Normalize data (e.g., log-transform)
data_log = log1p.(data)

# Dimensionality reduction with PCA
pca_result = MultivariateStats.fit(PCA, data_log, maxoutdim=10)
data_pca = MultivariateStats.transform(pca_result, data_log)

# Clustering (e.g., K-means)
kmeans_result = kmeans(data_pca, 5)

# Trajectory analysis (conceptual)
graph = Graph(5)  # Use Graphs.jl to model connections between clusters or cells

# Visualization
scatter(data_pca[:, 1], data_pca[:, 2], group=kmeans_result.assignments)

# Analyze perturbation effects by comparing trajectories from different conditions
# Perform further differential analysis along the pseudo-time trajectory
```

### Tools and Considerations:

- **Trajectory Libraries**: Julia lacks native pseudo-time analysis libraries comparable to Monocle or Slingshot. Using `RCall.jl` allows calling Monocle or Slingshot directly from Julia.
- **Performance**: Julia’s strength lies in custom analyses. Writing tailored scripts for data fitting and pathway comparisons can leverage Julia’s speed and flexibility.
- **Integrations**: Using `PyCall.jl`, Julia can interface with Python libraries such as `scanpy` for more advanced pseudo-time analysis if needed.

### Extensions for Perturbation Analysis:

- **Statistical Testing**: Use packages like `HypothesisTests.jl` to conduct differential gene expression tests.
- **Modeling Dynamic Changes**: Utilize `DifferentialEquations.jl` to simulate and model dynamic responses to perturbations.
- **Visualization Enhancements**: Highlight differentially expressed genes along trajectories with `Makie.jl` for more interactive visualizations.

This framework in Julia provides a flexible, high-performance approach for performing pseudo-time analysis and studying the effects of perturbations in cellular data.

### C++ snippet

**Pseudo-time analysis** is a computational approach used in systems biology to order cells along a continuum that represents a process such as cell differentiation, response to stimuli, or any transition where time-based information might not be available explicitly. This technique is powerful for detecting and analyzing how perturbations (e.g., drugs, genetic modifications) selectively impact biological processes.

Implementing pseudo-time analysis with C++ can be an efficient choice due to the language's performance and versatility. Below, I outline how one might approach this in C++, including key aspects of data structure design, computational methodology, and integration with analysis tools.

### 1. Problem Overview:

Detecting and analyzing perturbation effects involves:

- Mapping a series of observations (e.g., gene expression profiles from cells) onto a "pseudo-time" axis.
- Comparing pseudo-time progressions between control and perturbed datasets.
- Quantifying the selective effects of perturbations on the developmental trajectories or cellular states.

### 2. Data Representation:

In C++, efficient data structures are key for handling biological data:

- **Matrix Representation**: Use `std::vector<std::vector<double>>` or leverage third-party libraries such as *Eigen* or *Armadillo* for numerical computations.
- **Graph Representation** (for trajectory analysis): Use a graph library like *Boost Graph Library (BGL)* to represent cell states as nodes connected by weighted edges.
- **Sparse Data Structures**: If your data is sparse (e.g., single-cell RNA-seq data), libraries like *Eigen* or *Boost* can be helpful.

### 3. Pseudo-time Analysis Steps:

#### a. **Dimensionality Reduction**:

  - Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). These can be implemented using available C++ libraries such as *Armadillo* for PCA.
  - For more sophisticated non-linear reduction, integrate with third-party libraries or use custom code for *Diffusion Maps*.

#### b. **Trajectory Inference**:

  - Implement algorithms like *Monocle* or *Slingshot* for pseudo-time ordering:
    - **Graph-based ordering**: Build a minimum spanning tree (MST) or a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to capture the cell state transitions.
    - Use *Boost Graph Library* for constructing and analyzing graphs.
  - Develop a heuristic to assign cells along this inferred trajectory and determine their pseudo-time.

#### c. **Perturbation Analysis**:

  - Compute pseudo-time trajectories for control and perturbed datasets separately.
  - Calculate distances or divergences (e.g., Jensen-Shannon divergence) between distributions of pseudo-time values to quantify the effects of the perturbation.

### 4. Sample Code Snippets:

Below is a basic conceptual outline for implementing pseudo-time analysis in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <Eigen/Dense> // For PCA and matrix operations

// Function for simple PCA using Eigen
Eigen::MatrixXd performPCA(const Eigen::MatrixXd& data, int numComponents) {
    Eigen::MatrixXd centered = data.rowwise() - data.colwise().mean();
    Eigen::MatrixXd cov = (centered.adjoint() * centered) / double(data.rows() - 1);
    Eigen::SelfAdjointEigenSolver<Eigen::MatrixXd> solver(cov);

    // Get the top `numComponents` eigenvectors
    Eigen::MatrixXd eigenVectors = solver.eigenvectors().rightCols(numComponents);
    return centered * eigenVectors;
}

// Placeholder function for creating a trajectory graph
void createTrajectoryGraph() {
    // Use Boost Graph Library for building and analyzing the graph
    std::cout << "Graph-based trajectory construction is in progress." << std::endl;
}

// Main function to load data and execute analysis
int main() {
    // Load or generate data matrix (e.g., cells x genes)
    Eigen::MatrixXd data(100, 10); // Replace with actual data loading
    // Fill `data` with real values...

    // Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
    Eigen::MatrixXd reducedData = performPCA(data, 2);
    std::cout << "PCA completed. Reduced dimensions:\n" << reducedData << std::endl;

    // Create trajectory graph for pseudo-time analysis
    createTrajectoryGraph();

    // Placeholder for perturbation comparison logic
    std::cout << "Analysis of perturbation effects would proceed here." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### 5. Advanced Considerations:

- **Parallelization**: For larger datasets, consider multi-threading with *OpenMP* or using libraries like *Intel TBB* for parallel processing.
- **Integration with R/Python**: To leverage existing robust bioinformatics tools (e.g., Monocle3, Seurat), C++ can interoperate using bindings or by calling R/Python scripts from C++ using `system()` or C++-R/Python interfaces.
- **Visualization**: C++ visualization libraries like *Matplotlib-cpp* or exporting data for external tools such as Python’s `matplotlib` or R’s `ggplot2`.

### 6. Libraries and Tools:

- **Eigen**: High-performance matrix operations.
- **Armadillo**: Linear algebra library with a simple API.
- **Boost Graph Library**: Essential for constructing trajectory graphs.
- **OpenMP**: For parallel execution.
- **Integration Libraries**: *Rcpp* for R integration or *pybind11* for Python.

### Conclusion:

Pseudo-time analysis in C++ for detecting and analyzing perturbations can be achieved by combining graph theory, matrix algebra, and computational techniques. Implementing these methods from scratch allows customization and high performance, while integration with established libraries provides robustness and ease of use.
