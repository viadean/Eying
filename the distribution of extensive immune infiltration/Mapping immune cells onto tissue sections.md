# Mapping immune cells onto tissue sections

Mapping immune cells onto tissue sections involves visualizing and identifying the spatial distribution of immune cells within a tissue sample. This technique combines advanced imaging methods, such as immunohistochemistry or multiplex imaging, with computational analysis to precisely locate various immune cell types within their microenvironment. It provides crucial insights into how immune cells interact with each other and their surroundings, contributing to understanding diseases like cancer, infections, or autoimmune conditions. By linking immune cell localization to tissue architecture, this approach helps researchers uncover mechanisms of immune response and facilitates the development of targeted therapies and personalized medicine strategies.

Mapping immune cells onto tissue sections using spatial transcriptomics data in R involves analyzing gene expression patterns from spatial data, identifying immune cell types, and visualizing their spatial distribution on tissue sections. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

------

### **1. Install Required R Packages**

Install and load packages for spatial transcriptomics and immune cell analysis:

```R
# Install required packages
install.packages("Seurat")
install.packages("SpatialExperiment")
install.packages("SingleR")
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load the libraries
library(Seurat)
library(SpatialExperiment)
library(SingleR)
library(ggplot2)
```

For more advanced visualization and processing, you might need additional packages like `STUtility`, `patchwork`, or `sf`.

------

### **2. Load and Preprocess Spatial Transcriptomics Data**

Start by loading your spatial transcriptomics data. You can use formats such as Space Ranger outputs from 10x Genomics.

```R
# Load spatial transcriptomics data
spatial_data <- Load10X_Spatial(data.dir = "path_to_spatial_data/")

# Normalize and scale the data
spatial_data <- SCTransform(spatial_data, assay = "Spatial", verbose = FALSE)
```

------

### **3. Annotate Immune Cell Types**

To map immune cells, you need a reference dataset (e.g., `ImmGen`, `BlueprintEncode`, or `HumanPrimaryCellAtlasData`). The `SingleR` package allows automated cell type annotation.

```R
# Load reference dataset for immune cell annotation
reference <- HumanPrimaryCellAtlasData()

# Perform cell type annotation
immune_annotations <- SingleR(test = as.matrix(spatial_data@assays$Spatial@data),
                              ref = reference,
                              labels = reference$label.main)

# Add annotations to Seurat object
spatial_data$immune_type <- immune_annotations$labels
```

------

### **4. Map Immune Cells onto the Tissue Section**

Use `FeaturePlot` or `SpatialFeaturePlot` to visualize the spatial distribution of immune cells.

```R
# Highlight specific immune cell types (e.g., T cells)
FeaturePlot(spatial_data, features = c("immune_type"), label = TRUE, repel = TRUE)

# Spatial visualization
SpatialFeaturePlot(spatial_data, features = "immune_type")
```

------

### **5. Advanced Visualization and Clustering**

Cluster the cells to identify patterns and spatial relationships:

```R
# Clustering based on immune cell annotations
spatial_data <- FindNeighbors(spatial_data, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:20)
spatial_data <- FindClusters(spatial_data, resolution = 0.5)

# Visualize clusters
SpatialDimPlot(spatial_data, group.by = "immune_type")
```

------

### **6. Save Results**

Export annotated data or plots for downstream analysis:

```R
# Save the annotated data
saveRDS(spatial_data, file = "annotated_spatial_data.rds")

# Save plots
ggsave("immune_cells_distribution.png", plot = last_plot())
```

------

This workflow can be tailored based on your dataset and research goals. Ensure that your reference dataset matches the species and tissue type under investigation.

## :cactus:Julia snippet

Mapping immune cells onto tissue sections using **spatial transcriptomics** in Julia involves analyzing spatially-resolved gene expression data to localize and identify immune cells within the tissue microenvironment. Here's an outline of the process:

------

### **1. Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A **spatial transcriptomics dataset**: This typically includes spatial coordinates and gene expression matrices.
- **Cell type markers**: Specific genes or gene signatures associated with immune cell types (e.g., T-cells, B-cells, macrophages).
- A basic understanding of Julia programming and libraries.

------

### **2. Tools and Libraries**

Some useful Julia libraries for spatial and bioinformatics analysis:

- **Bio.jl**: For biological data processing.
- **DataFrames.jl**: For handling data frames.
- **Plots.jl**: For visualization.
- **SpatialEcology.jl**: For spatial analysis.
- **Clustering.jl**: For clustering analysis.

Install libraries using:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["Bio", "DataFrames", "Plots", "SpatialEcology", "Clustering"])
```

------

### **3. Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Load Spatial Transcriptomics Data**

Load the spatial transcriptomics data into Julia. The data typically includes:

- **Expression matrix**: Rows as spots and columns as genes.
- **Spatial coordinates**: X, Y coordinates for each spot.

Example:

```julia
using DataFrames

# Load data
expression_matrix = CSV.read("expression_matrix.csv", DataFrame)
coordinates = CSV.read("spatial_coordinates.csv", DataFrame)

# Merge data
spatial_data = hcat(coordinates, expression_matrix)
```

------

#### **Step 2: Identify Immune Cell Types**

Match gene expression profiles to known immune cell markers. Compute scores for each cell type based on marker genes using methods like:

- **Gene set scoring**: Sum or average expression of marker genes.
- **Correlation-based matching**.

Example:

```julia
function compute_cell_type_score(data, markers)
    scores = DataFrame()
    for (cell_type, genes) in markers
        scores[cell_type] = sum(data[:, genes], dims=2)
    end
    return scores
end

# Example markers
immune_markers = Dict(
    "T_cells" => ["CD3D", "CD3E", "CD4"],
    "B_cells" => ["CD19", "MS4A1"],
    "Macrophages" => ["CD68", "CD163"]
)

# Compute scores
immune_scores = compute_cell_type_score(expression_matrix, immune_markers)
```

------

#### **Step 3: Map Immune Cells onto Tissue**

Assign immune cell types to spatial locations by thresholding scores or clustering:

- **Thresholding**: Assign a cell type if the score exceeds a threshold.
- **Clustering**: Use clustering methods (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) to group similar spatial spots.

Example:

```julia
using Clustering

# K-means clustering based on immune scores
num_clusters = 3
clusters = kmeans(immune_scores, num_clusters)

# Add cluster labels to spatial data
spatial_data[:, :cluster] = clusters.assignments
```

------

#### **Step 4: Visualize Results**

Plot spatial distribution of immune cells overlaid on tissue sections.

```julia
using Plots

# Scatter plot of spatial data
scatter(
    spatial_data[:, :X], spatial_data[:, :Y],
    group=spatial_data[:, :cluster],
    title="Spatial Distribution of Immune Cells",
    legend=:topright
)
```

------

### **4. Advanced Techniques**

For more complex tasks, consider:

- **Deconvolution tools**: Integrate external tools like `Seurat` or `Scanpy` for more advanced cell type identification.
- **Integrating Julia with Python/R**: Use libraries like `PyCall` or `RCall` for compatibility with tools in other languages.
- **Machine learning**: Train custom models for cell type classification using `MLJ.jl`.

------

This pipeline provides a foundational approach for immune cell mapping using spatial transcriptomics in Julia. For further optimization, incorporate domain-specific techniques or explore open datasets for benchmarking.
