# Genomic pathology using Python

Genomic pathology is a field that integrates genomics and pathology to understand the molecular basis of diseases, such as cancer, and their progression at a cellular level. Python is an excellent tool for genomic pathology due to its libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Below is an overview of how Python can be utilized for genomic pathology:

------

### 1. **Genomic Data Analysis**

Genomic pathology involves analyzing large genomic datasets (e.g., from sequencing technologies like WGS, RNA-Seq).

#### Key Libraries:

- **Biopython**: For processing biological sequences.
- **Pandas**: For managing genomic datasets in tabular form.
- **numpy/scipy**: For numerical analysis.
- **HTSeq**: For high-throughput sequencing data.
- **PyVCF**: For parsing Variant Call Format (VCF) files.

#### Example:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

# Parsing a FASTA file with genomic sequences
for seq_record in SeqIO.parse("genome.fasta", "fasta"):
    print(f"Sequence ID: {seq_record.id}")
    print(f"Sequence Length: {len(seq_record.seq)}")
```

------

### 2. **Genomic Variant Annotation**

Understanding variations (e.g., SNPs, indels) is critical in pathology.

#### Tools:

- **ANNOVAR**: An external tool, but Python can automate processing.
- **PyEnsembl**: To access Ensembl genomic annotations.

#### Example:

```python
import pyensembl

# Accessing genomic annotations for a species
ensembl = pyensembl.EnsemblRelease(release=104, species="homo_sapiens")
gene = ensembl.gene_by_id("ENSG00000139618")
print(gene.name)  # BRCA2
```

------

### 3. **Pathology Image Analysis**

Digital pathology involves analyzing tissue images from histopathology slides.

#### Tools:

- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **scikit-image**: For segmentation and feature extraction.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)**: For advanced image analysis.

#### Example:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load a histopathology image
image = cv2.imread('pathology_slide.jpg')

# Convert to grayscale and apply threshold
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
_, threshold = cv2.threshold(gray, 128, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

cv2.imshow("Threshold Image", threshold)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

------

### 4. **Multi-Omics Data Integration**

Integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data to derive insights.

#### Libraries:

- **SciPy/Pandas**: For statistical and data integration tasks.
- **Scikit-learn**: For clustering and machine learning tasks.
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: For building predictive models.

#### Example:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import pandas as pd

# Simulate transcriptomic and genomic data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'gene1': [10, 15, 20],
    'gene2': [5, 10, 15],
    'gene3': [1, 3, 5]
})

# Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(data)
print(reduced_data)
```

------

### 5. **Clinical Genomics**

Applications include identifying biomarkers or predicting disease progression.

#### Tools:

- **Lifelines**: For survival analysis.
- **Kaplan-Meier Plotting**: Integrated with Matplotlib for survival curves.

#### Example:

```python
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter

# Simulated survival data
survival_time = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
event_occurred = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

kmf = KaplanMeierFitter()
kmf.fit(survival_time, event_occurred)
kmf.plot_survival_function()
```

------

### 6. **Machine Learning in Genomic Pathology**

- **Applications**: Classifying disease subtypes, detecting mutations, or predicting treatment outcomes.
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow.

#### Example:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Example dataset
X = [[10, 5, 3], [15, 8, 7], [20, 10, 10]]
y = [0, 1, 1]

# Splitting the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train a classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)
```

------

### 7. **Data Visualization**

Presenting insights through visualizations helps in interpreting genomic data.

#### Tools:

- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For traditional plots.
- **Plotly**: For interactive genomics plots.

#### Example:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot gene expression
expression_data = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
sns.lineplot(x=range(len(expression_data)), y=expression_data)
plt.show()
```
